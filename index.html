        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>
            On a space station on the outskirts of the solar system, a group of astronauts astronauts are preparing to overthrow their commander!
        </p>
            
        <h3>GOAL</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rebels - Win by eliminating the Commander.</li>
                <li>Crew - Win by eliminating all Rebels while the Commander Is still alive.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>    
            
        <h3>SETUP</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Separate the Character Cards and Action Cards into two decks.</li>
            <li>Remove the extra Character Cards from the game so that the Character Deck contains the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>For 5 players: 2 Crew, 2 Rebels</li>
                    <li>For 6 players: 3 Crew, 2 Rebels</li>
                    <li>For 7 players: 3 Crew, 3 Rebels</li>
                    <li>For 8 players: 4 Crew, 3 Rebels</li>
                    <li>The commander is always included.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shuffle each deck.</li>
            <li>Deal every player 1 Action Card and 1 Character Card (all cards face down).</li>
            <li>The Commander reveals their Character Card. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            After the first game, The Commander is passed clockwise instead of shuffled with the other Character Cards.
        </p>
            
        <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
        <p>The Commander goes first. Turns move clockwise.</p>
        <p>Discarding: There is no discard pile. When a card is discarded, it is placed on the bottom of the Action Deck.</p>
        <p>Taking a Turn: On each turn, a player may only take one of the following actions
            <ul>
                <li>Draw - A player may discard their Action Card then draw a new one.</li>
                <li>Trade - Swap cards with another player.  Keep the cards face down. You cannot mingle with a player who mingled with you on their last turn. The Commander may decline a player who attempts to trade with him. That player’s turn immediately ends.</li>
                <li>Play an Action Card - Reveal your action card and follow the rules written on it. Some cards may be played out of turn. See the Action Card Index for specific rules for each card.</li>
                <li>Pass - Pass the turn without an action.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>In games with an odd number of players, the last rebel alive can take 2 actions on their turn.</p>
        <p>First Round: On each player’s first turn, they may only draw a new Action Card or pass their turn. Swapping and playing cards is prohibited.</p>
        <p>When multiple cards are played on the same turn, they are discarded in the order they are played.</p>
        <p>Refilling Players’ Hands: At the end of each turn, all players without cards draw a new card in the same order they played their cards.</p>
        <p>When a player is eliminated, their Character Card is turned face up in front of them, and their Action Card is discarded. Players may choose to reveal their action card or keep it secret</p>
        <p>Table talk is encouraged, but so is lying.</p>
        <p>You may not show other players your cards. Intentionally doing this is against the rules and punishable by death.</p>
        
        <h3>ACTION CARD INDEX</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ejection - Reveal the Ejection and choose one other player to eliminate from the game.</li>
            <li>Ambush - Do not reveal the Ambush. Trade with another player. The player who receives the Ambush is eliminated. You take their Action Card.</li>
            <li>Sacrifice - The Sacrifice may be used anytime another player is eliminated. Reveal the sacrifice and die in their place.</li>
            <li>Tether - The Tether counters the Ejection. Whenever a player uses an Ejection, reveal the  Tether and stay in the game. The Tether can only be used to protect yourself.</li>
            <li>Bomb - The Bomb may only be played by the Rebels. To activate the bomb, lay it face up in front of you and do not draw another Action Card. On your next turn the Bomb explodes, and the Rebels win. While the Bomb is active, nobody can trade with you.</li>
            <li>Uprising - The Uprising brings all eliminated rebels back into the game. It can only be played once per game</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>OTHER WAYS TO PLAY</h3>
        <p>4 Players: In this variant, The Commander is not controlled by a player. He is dealt an action card, can be traded with, and is immune to the Ambush.</p>
        <p>Keeping Score: After each game, players on the winning team receive a point. The first player to reach 5 points wins (keep track on </p>
